## Overview
**ORBA** is a high-performance, next-generation neural arcade and educational terminal. It combines immersive synchronization games like **Perspective Prism** with tactical training modules such as **Metropolitan Academy (Police Powers UK)**. 

Designed with a "State-of-the-Art" service-terminal aesthetic, ORBA utilizes glassmorphism, cinematic micro-interactions, and real-time physics to deliver a premium user experience.

## Core Features
- **Perspective Prism**: A neural synchronization gauntlet featuring 25 phases of high-speed alignment. Includes "Chronos Field" time-dilation mechanics and persistent difficulty staging.
- **Metropolitan Academy**: An S-Tier educational sim for UK Police Powers (PACE Act 1984). Features dynamic scenarios, NDM/THRIVE assessments, and professional feedback loops.
- **Neural Identity System**: Client-side persistent profiles using localized data arrays.
- **Responsive Architecture**: Fully optimized for desktop and mobile neural interfaces.
- **S-Tier Aesthetics**: Sillitoe Tartan accents, CRT scanline overlays, and layered volumetric glows.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (React 19)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 (Alpha/Inline Theme Engine)
- **Animation**: Framer Motion (Spring Physics & AnimatePresence)
- **Iconography**: Lucide React
- **Graphics**: Three.js (@react-three/fiber)
- **Logic**: TypeScript 5+

## Deployment & Development
1. **Initialize Terminal**: `npm install`
2. **Synchronize Environment**: `npm run dev`
3. **Neural Optimization**: `npm run build`
